# An Introduction TO Seismology

This website is about the science of Seismology. It includes two different type of webpages. 
1. **Articles**, where the user can read about different earthquake related, phenomena
2. **Interactive tools**, that the user can use real seismological data and try the available tools 

Feel free to use it and provide me with some feedback about things that i could improve.
