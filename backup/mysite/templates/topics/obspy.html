<h1>Basic structure</h1>
<p>
    The main structure of the Obspy library consists of the <code>Trace</code> and the <code>Stream</code> objects. The
    <code>Trace</code> represents
    a single time series record of seismic data recorded at a single station or sensor. It's essentially a single
    waveform with associated metadata
    (e.g., station code, sampling frequency, starting time of the recording etc.).
    The <code>Stream</code> is a container of one or more <code>Trace</code> objects. Typically, a <code>Stream</code>
    contains three recordings or traces: two with horizontal
    components (e.g., North-South and East-West) and one with a vertical component. Each <code>Trace</code> offers
    several attributes that provide information about the recording and
    methods that apply a calculation on the respective recording.

        <figcaption>The structure of the obspy library. A <code>Stream</code> object consists of one or more
            <code>Trace</code> objects. Each <code>Trace</code> represents a single waveform or recording and has
            different methods (.taper(), .filter(), etc.) and attributes (.data, .stats, etc.)</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    For instance, the <code>.data</code> attribute of a <code>Trace</code> provides its time series data samples and the
    <code>.stats</code> returns an object that holds metadata or seismic parameters associated with the trace, such as
    the sampling frequency, start time, end time, network, station, and other relevant information.
    In addition, the <code>filter()</code> method, filters the time series data within a specific frequency range and
    the <code>trim()</code> method
    cuts the time series between a specific start and end times.
</p>
<p>
    Obspy supports several <a target="_blank" class="link-info"
        href="https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.read.html">file formats</a> to read data.
    One of the most used seimic file format is the MiniSEED format. It is a binary file used to store time series data
    in a compact and
    efficient format that includes information about the station, location, timing, and the actual waveform data.
    MiniSEED files are widely
    used in seismology and are the standard format for sharing and archiving seismic data.
</p>
<p>
    Before we continue, start by initializing the functions that we will use throughout the rest of the tutorial:

<h1>Obspy Date and Time Manipulation</h1>
<p>
    Obspy offers extensive support for date and time manipulation. It includes the <code>UTCDateTime</code> object to
    represent date and time.
    For instance the start date and the end date of a recording, which are saved as <code>starttime</code> and
    <code>endtime</code> in the metadata information
    of a <code>Trace</code> object (in the <code>.stats</code> attribute), are both a <code>UTCDateTime</code> data
    type.
</p>
<p>
    One way to create a <code>UTCDateTime</code> object is by using a Python string:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/c44b83682d43a63c8a3fdef9acd59301.js"></script>
<p>
    You can perform addition, subtraction and extract multiple attributes from this object using the dot notation:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/1c7cc6560801d1997a3778d43a6afe3b.js"></script>

<p>Last but not least, one can subtract <code>UTCDateTime</code> objects and get the difference of them in seconds:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/d02d9c3c8c936bea6292c4112873311b.js"></script>
<p>
    The <code>starttime</code> and <code>endtime</code> keys in the header information of the recordings need to be in a
    <code>UTCDateTime</code> data type.
    Therefore, if you intend to modify these keys within
    the <code>trace.stats</code> dictionary-like header, convert your datetime string into the
    <code>UTCDateTime</code> format.
</p>

<h1>Attributes and Methods</h1>
<p>
    Within ObsPy, you'll find an array of attributes and methods
    associated with the <code>Trace</code> class for accessing
    recording information, seismic file handling, and applying
    waveform processing techniques. To begin with, utilize the Obspy
    <code>read()</code> function to read a file of a recording took
    place on <code>04 April, 2014</code>
    at <code>20:08:20</code> and recorded by <i>CH03</i> station:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/cef71d4af3fa102e54e6fe888ff774a6.js"></script>

<p>
    The file is a MiniSEED file that contains 3 traces or records
    each with a different component (E, N, Z). We can see the start
    and the end time of the record, the sampling frequency in Hz
    and the total samples. Let's get this information for the first
    trace of the <code>Stream</code> object:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/13ce0156258101d85cfacc4930d42e04.js"></script>
<p>
    We can observe multiple key-value pairs that contain the seismic parameters, such as the station code or name which
    is <i>CH03</i>, the component of the record which is East-West (E) and the the sampling frequency or sampling rate
    of 100 Hz. Several other parameters are also apparent like the starting and the ending date of the record
    (starttime, endtime), the sample distance in seconds (dt), the total number of sample
    points (npts) and more. The output is a <code>obspy.core.trace.Stats</code> object which is a <code>dict-like</code>
    object that you can get and set the values.
</p>
<p>
    In order to check the traces visually, get the sample data and the time information of the recordings using the
    <code>.data</code> attribute and the <code>.times()</code> method respectively, and plot them using the Matplotlib
    Python library.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/cfb72283ff0b9cc284c56f141a55a850.js"></script>

        <figcaption>Recordings of the MiniSEED file plotted using the matplotlib library</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    We could achieve a similar result by just using the <code>st.plot()</code> method of the <code>Stream</code> object
    (st):
</p>
<div class="figure-container">

        <img src="/static/img/ch03_mseed_plot_method.png" alt="mseed plot">
        <figcaption>Recordings of the MiniSEED file plotted using the <code>.plot()</code> method of the
            <code>stream</code> object</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    This method can get some <a class="link-info" target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.plot.html">parameters</a> to control the
    styling of the plots such as the color of the waveforms, the size of the plot, the rotation and size of the
    x axis labels and more.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the <code>Trace</code> object includes several methods that apply a specific calculation on the time
    series of the recording.
    For example, apply a bandpass at the previous recording between 1 and 3 Hz using the Obspy <a target="_blank"
        class="link-info"
        href="https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Trace.filter.html">obspy.core.trace.Trace.filter</a>
    method.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/14848d53828c53eb1706b7a827ea7831.js"></script>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="/static/img/obspy-filter-mseed.png" alt="mseed plot">
        <figcaption>Apply a bandpass filter between 1 and 3 Hz at the recording using the Obspy <code>filter()</code>
            method</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    These computations can be applied on the <code>Stream</code> object at once, or at each <code>Trace</code> of the
    <code>Stream</code>, individually. For instance,
    trim each recording to get the signal part of the recordings:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/3f86114b356f449edf1d1a1ec8fdc069.js"></script>
<div class="figure-container">

        <figcaption>Trim the time series to get the signal part</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    These computations happen inplace on the <code>Stream</code> object. Create a copy of it using the
    <code>.copy()</code> method to create a new object if you don't want to change it.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, save the trimmed <code>Stream</code> object on your local hard drive using the <code>Stream</code>
    <code>.write()</code> method:
</p>

<h1>Generating Trace and Stream objects from data</h1>
<p>
    In addition to reading seismological file formats, you have the flexibility to create your own <code>Trace</code>
    and <code>Stream</code> objects using ObsPy's
    <code>obspy.core.trace.Trace</code> and <code>obspy.core.stream.Stream</code> classes. To create a
    <code>Trace</code> object, begin by
    supplying the data values of the recording (e.g., acceleration) as a NumPy <code>ndarray</code> to the
    <code>data</code> parameter within
    <code>obspy.core.trace.Trace</code>, and include the recording's metadata in a Python dictionary provided to the
    <code>header</code> parameter.
    Do this for each trace you want to create. Then, gather all the generated <code>Trace</code> objects into a Python
    list and pass it into the
    <code>traces</code> parameter in the <code>obspy.core.stream.Stream</code> class to construct a <code>Stream</code>
    object.
</p>
<p>
    Below is presented a seismic recording from the <i>ZAK2</i> station, containing data for three channels (E, N, Z).
    This data file includes metadata
    information positioned at the file's header, followed by data for each component. Our goal is to read this file and
    assemble a <code>Stream</code>
    object comprising three individual traces.
</p>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="/static/img/record-txt-file.png" alt="mseed record ASCII file">
        <figcaption>Acceleration data in raw ASCII format. The first lines contain the record metadata and the rest of
            the lines the acceleration data of the three components</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Start by reading the file and collecting the file header information in order to build a dictionary of the seismic
    parameters. Don't forget to convert
    the number of points (npts) into a Python <code>int</code> datatype, the sampling frequency (fs) into a
    <code>float</code> datatype and the start time of the record (<code>starttime</code>) into a
    <code>UTCDateTime</code> object.
    Also it is important for the keys of the dictionary, to be one of the options provided in the
    <a target="_blank" class="link-info"
        href="https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Stats.html"><code>obspy.core.trace.Stats</code>
    </a> object:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/aa31087909ed1dd16eafd7dcf73a8961.js"></script>
<p>
    Then we use the python Pandas library to read the acceleration values of the traces:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/50688fc36befeaf57f2e7dd1076a833a.js"></script>
<p>
    At this time we have the metadata and the data of the traces. Using these two parameters, we can create the
    <code>Trace</code> objects. To do this, loop trough the components, create a header dictionary file for each
    <code>Trace</code> and add its data
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/165bea0905ccd37d5f1f9497b3a1460a.js"></script>
<p>Finally, create the <code>Stream</code> object, from the list of the traces:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/ee7d33d5071c7199fc13a19c0452fd25.js"></script>
