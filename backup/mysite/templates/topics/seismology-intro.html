<h1>What is an Earthquake?</h1>
<p>
    An earthquake is a natural phenomenon that occurs when there is a <i>sudden release of energy</i> in the Earth's
    crust, resulting in seismic
    waves that cause the ground to shake. This shaking can range from minor tremors that are barely noticeable to
    violent movements that can cause
    widespread destructions. Earthquakes can be generated in various ways such as along the edges of the tectonic plates
    that constitute the earth,
    along seismic faults far from the edges of the tectonic plates (intraplate earthquakes), volcanic activity, human
    activity (induced seismicity) etc.
</p>
<p>
    Tectonic plates are part of the lithosphere of the Earth. They are in constant motion between one another due to the
    heat-driven convection currents in
    the Earth's mantle. When the edges of these plates interact, they can grind against each other, pull apart, or
    collide. The stress and pressure that
    build up at these plate boundaries can be released suddenly and create an earthquake. The largest earthquakes
    typically occur at plate boundaries.

            of the Earth</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Earthquakes can also originate from the sudden movement along active faults within a single tectonic plate. Active
    faults are fractures in the Earth's
    crust that have experienced recent movement, and they can accumulate stress over time. When the stress along these
    faults becomes too great, the rocks can
    slip suddenly, generating seismic waves and causing an earthquake.

    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Earthquakes can have a wide range of effects, including ground shaking, surface rupture, landslides,
    tsunamis (if the earthquake occurs under the ocean), and damage to buildings and infrastructure. The severity of an
    earthquake's impact depends
    on its magnitude (energy released), its distance from the epicenter, and local geological conditions.
</p>

<h1>Seismic Waves</h1>
<p>
    The released energy travels through the earth material in the form of seismic waves. These waves carry valuable
    information about the
    Earth's interior structure and composition. Seismic waves can be mainly categorized into two types of waves: <i>body
        waves</i> and
    <i>surface waves</i>.
</p>

<h2>Body Waves</h2>
<p>
    <i>Body waves</i> are a type of seismic waves that travel through the Earth's interior layers. There are two main
    types of body
    waves: <i>P-waves</i> (primary or compressional waves) and <i>S-waves</i>
    (secondary or shear waves).
</p>
<p>
    Compressional or P waves are the fastest seismic waves and are the first to be detected at a seismic
    station after an earthquake event. They travel through solid and liquid materials. It's wave motion causes the
    particles in the rock to move
    in the same direction as the one that the wave is propagating. This movement is in the form of compression and
    expansion like a spring.
</p>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/p-waves.gif') }}">
        <figcaption>Propagation of P waves </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    On the other hand, shear waves are another type of body waves which are slower that the P waves, and they arrive at
    a later time at the seismic station. They can only pass through solid
    materials, due to its wave motion that cause particles in the rock to move perpendicular to the direction of wave
    propagation. This
    movement is in a side-to-side or up-and-down motion, resembling the movement of a rope. S-waves are responsible
    for the most severe shaking and structural damage after an earthuake. Due to its motion the S waves can be further
    classified to <i>SH</i> or
    <i>horizontal shear</i> and <i>SV</i> or <i>vertical shear</i> waves. The SH waves have a horizontal shearing
    motion, causing particles to
    move side-to-side in a horizontal direction. This side-to-side motion is similar to the movement of a snake. The SV
    waves have a vertical shearing motion, causing particles to move up and down in a vertical direction.

    </figure>
</div>

<h2>Surface Waves</h2>
<p>
    <i>Surface waves</i> are another type of seismic waves that travel along the Earth's surface rather than propagating
    through
    its interior. These waves are produced by the complex interactions of compressional (P) and shear (S) waves with the
    Earth's surface. Surface waves have a distinct motion that is similar to the movement of ocean
    waves. They move slower than P-waves and S-waves but can have larger amplitudes, making them particularly impactful
    during
    earthquakes. Surface waves are responsible for much of the ground shaking and damage experienced in seismic events.
    There are
    two main types of surface waves: <i>Love waves</i>, which have a side-to-side motion resembling a snake's slither,
    and
    <i>Rayleigh waves</i>, which produce an elliptical, rolling motion.

</div>

<h1>Earthquake concepts</h1>
<p>
    Seismic waves are generated at a source called <i>focus</i> or <i>hypocenter</i>, which can be natural, such as an
    earthquake or artificial, such as an explosion.
    The generated waves travel through the earth medium and are recorded at a <i>receiver</i>. The receiver is known as
    the <i>seismometer</i>
    and the record of the ground motion at the seismometer is called the <i>seismogram</i>. A seismogram, contains
    information
    about both the source and the medium. The earth <i>medium</i>, or subsurface, refers to the material through which
    seismic waves travel,
    which can include rock layers, soil, and fluids.
</p>
<p>
    If the origin time when the waves left the source is known, their arrival time at the receiver gives the <i>travel
        time</i> required
    to pass through the medium. This time gives information about the speed at which they traveled and generally about
    the physical
    properties of the medium. In addition because the amplitude of the waves are affected by the medium, the signals
    observed on
    seismograms provide additional information about the portion of the earth that the waves traveled through.
</p>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/source-medium-station.png') }}">
        <figcaption>Seismic waves are generated at a source or focus, travel through the earth medium and are recorded
            at a receiver or seismometer at the surface.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    The seismic waves can be highly affected by the <i>underground geology</i>, a phenomenon known as <i>site
        effect</i>. The underground structure can greatly amplify or
    deamplify the amplitude of the incoming ground motion as well as change its frequency content.
</p>
<p>
    The distance between the source and the station that recorded the earthquake is known as <i>Hypocentral
        Distance</i>. It provides
    information about the direct path that seismic waves take to reach an observation point. On the other hand,
    <i>Epicentral Distance</i> is the distance from the <i>epicenter</i>, which is the point directly above the
    hypocenter on the
    Earth's surface, to the station. These distances are essential in assessing the intensity and impact of seismic
    events, aiding in
    understanding their effects on structures and communities.
</p>

<h1>Seismic phases</h1>
<p>
    In addition to the direct P and S waves, there are other related waves that arise from the interactions of the
    seismic
    waves with the various layers and boundaries within the Earth. These phases play a crucial role in unraveling the
    Earth's
    intricate internal structure. For instance, there is a phase of the compressional (P) wave that can occur after it
    reflects the surface and then is recorded at the receiver (PP). Another, happens when then P wave reflects the outer
    core and then
    end up at the receiver (PcP) or when the P wave travels through the mantle, the outer and the inner core and then
    ends up at the
    surface (PKIKP). Similar seismic phases can be generated from the direct shear (S) waves and its interactions with
    the underground layers.

        <figcaption>Various seismic phases generated from the interactions of the body waves and the earth's interior
            layers</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Seismologists use these seismic phases to uncover the secrets of Earth's deep layers. By studying when and how these
    phases arrive,
    scientists explore the mysteries of our planet's hidden geology, enhancing our understanding of Earth's complexity
    and dynamics.
</p>

<h1>Seismic Faults</h1>
<p>
    Earthquakes almost always happen along faults, where one part of the Earth's surface shifts relative to the other.
    These faults are often
    recognized through geological mapping, revealing historical fault movements. As per the elastic rebound theory,
    stress builds up on opposite
    sides of the fault, effectively locking it. When the accumulated strain overcomes the fault's strength, it suddenly
    releases, causing the
    fault to slip and triggering an earthquake. The upper or overlying block along the fault plane (assuming that a
    fault is a planar surface) is called the
    <i>hanging wall</i> and the block that lies underneath is called the <i>footwall</i>.
</p>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/fault-type-general.png') }}">
        <figcaption>A fault is assumed to be a planar surface. The block located
            above the fault plane is called the hanging wall and the block below, the footwall</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    To describe the geometry of a fault, we need to assume that a fault is a planar surface across which relative motion
    accurs
    during an earthquake. The coordinate axis used to describe the fault are the <code>X1</code> axis that is called the
    <i>strike</i> of the fault (the instersection of the fault plane with the surface), the <code>X2</code> axis that is
    perpedicular to the <code>X1</code> axis and <code>X3</code> axis that it points upward and is
    perpendicular to the other two.
</p>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/fault-geometry.png') }}">
        <figcaption>The geometry of a seismic fault</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    The fault geometry can be completely described using two different coordinate systems:
    a) <code>n</code>, <code>d</code> and b) <code>φ</code>, <code>δ</code>, <code>λ</code>. The first coordinate system
    uses the <i>normal</i> vector on the
    fault plane (<code>n</code>) and the perpendicular to the normal vector, the <i>slip</i> vector, <code>d</code> that
    shows the direction of motion, that is the direction in which the
    upper side of the fault (hanging wall) moved with respect to the lower side (foot wall). The second system, consists
    of the <i>dip angle</i> <code>δ</code>, that gives the orientation of
    the fault plane with respect to the surface, the counterclockwise measured <i>slip angle</i> <code>λ</code> measured
    from the
    <code>X1</code> axis, that gives the direction of motion or the motion of the hanging wall block with respect to the
    foot wall block and lastly the <i>fault strike</i> <code>φ</code> that is the angle measured
    clockwise from the North to the <code>X1</code> axis.
</p>
<p>
    Due to different values of the slip angle (0-360 degrees) we can classify the faults into three categories:
    a) normal faulting, b) reverse or thrust faulting, c) strike-slip faulting. However, most earthquakes consists of
    some combination of these motions and have slip angles between these values.
</p>

<h2>Normal-slip faulting</h2>
<p>
    This describes a <i>dip-slip</i> motion. In this position, the hanging wall moves downwards relative
    to the foot wall, indicating normal fault activity. In this case, the slip angle is 270 degrees.
</p>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/normal-slip-fault.gif') }}">
        <figcaption>Normal slip faulting. The hanging wall moves downwards relative
            to the foot wall in which the slip angle is 270 degrees</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<h2>Reverse-slip faulting</h2>
<p>
    This also describes a <i>dip-slip</i> motion. In this position, the hanging wall moves upwards relative
    to the foot wall, indicating reverse fault activity. The slip angle is 90 degrees.
</p>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/reverse-slip-fault.gif') }}">
        <figcaption>Reverse slip faulting. The hanging wall moves upwards relative
            to the foot wall in which the slip angle is 90 degrees</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<h2>Strike-slip faulting</h2>
<p>
    When the two sides of the fault slide horizontally by each other, a pure strike-slip occurs. Depending
    on the direction of movement when viewed from one side of the fault, the slip can be described as left-lateral or
    right-lateral. When the slip angle is zero, the hanging wall moves to the right and the motion is
    <i>left-lateral</i>.
    Similarly, for slip angle at 180 degrees, a <i>right-lateral</i> motion occurs.
</p>

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/strike-slip-fault.gif') }}">
        <figcaption>Left-lateral strike-slip fault.
            This movement results in a 0-degree slip angle, as the relative motion is in the opposite direction when
            compared to the reference point on the other side of the fault</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<h1>Seismic Hazards</h1>
<p>
    One of the most significant seismic hazards is the <i>shaking of the ground</i>. When an earthquake happens, waves
    spread out
    from the source and move quickly through the Earth's outer layer. When these
    waves reach the surface, they cause the ground to shake, which can last a few seconds or even minutes. Most of the
    problems
    caused by earthquakes come from this shaking. If there's not much shaking, the other issues related to earthquakes
    might not
    be a big concern. But when the shaking is powerful, it can lead to various problems like landslides or collapsing
    buildings.
</p>
<p>
    Undoubtedly, the most striking and unforgettable depictions of earthquake devastation are the <i>structural
        hazards</i>.
    From the anticipated collapse of poorly fortified masonry and adobe buildings, where numerous individuals in less
    developed
    regions reside, to the unexpected ruination of more contemporary constructions, structural impairment remains a
    primary factor
    contributing to both loss of life and financial setbacks in numerous seismic events.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the most remarkable instances of earthquake-related destruction have taken place when soil deposits lose
    their
    solidity and seem to transform into fluid-like substances. This occurrence, known as <i>liquefaction</i>, entails a
    significant reduction in the soil's strength, often to the extent that it's incapable of providing support to
    structures or
    retaining stability. Liquefaction is primarily observed in saturated soils, making it most prevalent in close
    proximity to
    rivers, bays, and other water bodies.
</p>
<p>
    Powerful earthquakes frequently trigger <i>landslides</i>. While most of these landslides are minor in scale,
    seismic events
    have also led to substantial slides. Regrettably, in certain instances, landslides triggered by earthquakes have
    completely
    covered towns and villages. More frequently, earthquake-triggered landslides cause harm by demolishing structures or
    disrupting bridges and other constructed structures.
</p>
<p>
    The rapid vertical movements of the seafloor due to fault ruptures during earthquakes can result in the formation of
    <i>tsunamis</i>,
    which are lengthy sea waves with extended periods. When in the open ocean, tsunamis cover vast distances at
    significant
    speeds, yet they are challenging to detect. Their usual height remains under 1 meter, while their wavelengths can
    span several
    hundred kilometers. However, as a tsunami nears the coastline, the reduction in water depth causes its speed to
    decrease and
    the wave's height to increase. In specific coastal regions, the seabed's configuration might amplify the wave,
    giving rise to an
    almost perpendicular wall of water that surges far inland, causing catastrophic devastation. When earthquakes
    generate waves
    in enclosed water bodies, these are referred to as <i>seiches</i>. Typically brought about by seismic waves with
    long periods that
    match the natural oscillation period of water within a lake or reservoir, seiches can manifest over extensive
    distances from
    the earthquake's source.
