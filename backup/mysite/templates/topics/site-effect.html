<h1>What is site effect ?</h1>
<p>
    The input motion that arrives at the surface of the Earth is affected by the nature of the seismic source, the
    medium or the
    Earth's material that it is traveling through and the underground geology. Site effect is the influence of the
    underground geological structure
    at the seismic motion while it approaches the Earth's surface. That alters greatly
    the characteristics of the seismic ground motion such as the amplitude of the waveform,
    the frequency distribution, and the duration of the shaking. Site effect can greatly amplify the magnitude of the
    seismic motion
    often by nearly two orders of magnitude. Hence, it demands diligent consideration.

    </figure>
</div>
<h1>Local Site Conditions Effect</h1>
<p>
    Input motion can be influenced by various geological conditions beneath a site. These conditions include a range of
    physical
    processes, including multiple reflections and diffractions of trapped ground motion due to the geometry of
    underlying structure,
    deep sedimentary basins below the site, topographic irregularities, the softness of the soil etc. The following
    effects can greatly
    influence the strong ground motion at a site.
</p>
<h2>Softness of the Underground Material</h2>
<p>
    The elastic properties of the Earth's materials ranges from hard
    rock materials to soft sediments. Seismic waves travel faster through hard rocks than through softer rocks and
    sediments.
    As the waves pass from deep, hard rocks to shallow and soft sediments they slow down and get bigger in amplitude due
    to the
    conservation of energy and as a result amplify the ground motion. Just like tsunamis get bigger while they approach
    the coast (decrease of depth). The softer the rock or soil under
    a site is, the larger the wave.
</p>

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/softness.png') }}" alt="softness of the geological rocks">
        <figcaption>Elastic properties of the underground medium below the surface. The input motion travels towards
            surface layers with lower velocity and density that results in higher amplitudes at the surface due to the
            conservation of energy</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<h2>Geological Basins</h2>
<p>
    The curvature of a basin in which softer alluvial soils have been deposited can trap body waves and cause
    some incident body waves to propagate through the alluvium as surface waves. These waves can produce stronger
    shaking and longer
    durations.

        <figcaption>Underground basin geometry affects the ground motion characteristics. Multiple reflections can
            greatly increase the amplitude of the motion at the surface due to the conversion of body waves to surface
            waves</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<h2>Topographic Irregularities</h2>
<p>
    The interaction of waves can produce complex patterns of amplification and deamplification depending
    on the geometry of the irregularity (triangular wedges, troughs, crests) and on the types, frequencies and angles of
    incidence of the incoming waves.

            Kramer, Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering)</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<h2>How can we estimate site effects?</h2>
<p>
    The first thing that comes to mind when this question is asked, is: <q><em>Can site effects be predicted ?</em></q>
    The answer comes from
    a scientific paper published by <span class="author-ref">David M. Boore (2004)</span>:
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
    <q><i>The answer to the title question is: <i>it depends</i>. It depends on what kind of site response is being
            predicted and
            what accuracy is needed in the prediction. The main message of this paper is that variability in ground
            motions is large,
            making it difficult to predict site-specific, earthquake-specific site response accurately. On the other
            hand predictions of mean
            amplifications for many events and a group of sites sharing somewhat similar geologic conditions can be done
            with some
            accuracy. Common to any site response is a reference condition: Site response is always relative to
            something.</i></q>

<p>
    Despite this, various methods exist for estimating site effects, with one of the simplest being the categorization
    of sites based on soil
    type. In the past decade, earthquake regulations have increasingly shifted towards using the V<sub>s30</sub> value
    (the
    time-averaged shear wave velocity over the top 30 meters) as a basis for site classification.

    However, the effectiveness of using V<sub>s30</sub> as the sole proxy for assessing site effects has been questioned
    in several
    studies. These studies propose the consideration of complementary or alternative parameters. For instance, some
    investigations
    explore the utilization of the fundamental frequency (f<sub>0</sub>) of the site, as an alternative or supplementary
    indicator
    alongside V<sub>s30</sub> (<span class="author-ref">Cadet et al. 2012, Luzi et al. 2011</span>). This highlights the
    insufficiency of relying solely on V<sub>s30</sub> as a single proxy for
    site-response assessment. Other researchers recommend a combined approach, where the peak amplification frequency
    (f<sub>peak</sub>)
    is integrated with V<sub>s30</sub> to enhance the accuracy of site response predictions (<span
        class="author-ref">Baram et al. 2020, Hassani and Atkinson, 2016</span>). Additionally, some
    studies suggest that a pair of variables, the average shear wave velocity, V<sub>s,z</sub> over the top z meters
    and the site fundamental frequency (f<sub>0</sub>) offer the best discrimination of soil characteristics (<span
        class="author-ref">Cadet et al. 2008</span>).
    These variables are independent and provide a comprehensive representation of different aspects of soil response.
    V<sub>s30</sub>
    pertains to the average response within the first 30 meters, while f<sub>0</sub> combines information about soil
    stiffness and the
    depth to bedrock.
</p>
<p>
    An alternative empirical approach involves the direct extraction of site amplification factors in the frequency
    domain from
    observed seismic records. Given that observed ground motion reflects the combined influences of the seismic source,
    propagation path, and site-specific characteristics, a methodology is necessary to separate and analyze the site
    effects inherent
    in the data.
</p>
<p>
    A straightforward yet
    effective strategy involves computing spectral ratios between two adjacent records obtained from locations with
    different
    soil conditions. Ideally, this involves a comparison between a free-field site (no amplification) situated on
    unaltered hard rock outcrops and a
    site resting on soft sedimentary layers.
</p>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/bedrock-surface-outcrop-motion.png') }}"
            alt="site effect motions in surface and in the bedrock">
        <figcaption>Seismic records at different locations at a site. We can observe the bedrock motion that has no
            amplification, the surface site motion with increased record amplitude, the outcrop motion with little
            amplification and the borehole recording with some amplification.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    However, in practice, it's often challenging to identify a completely site-effect-free
    reference location due to topographical irregularities around the site or the presence of weathered layers beneath
    it, both of
    which can introduce substantial site effects. Moreover, a reference site that is entirely unaffected by site
    amplifications may
    be geographically distant from the target site. To overcome these limitations, the installation of borehole stations
    directly
    beneath surface stations allows for the observation of wave propagation phenomena between these points. It's worth
    noting,
    though, that the seismic data acquired from a borehole, even within bedrock, differs from the motion observed at a
    surface
    outcrop. Borehole stations capture both incident waves propagating upwards from below and reflected waves traveling
    back from
    the surface. Additionally, it's important to acknowledge that borehole measurements can be considerably more
    expensive to
    implement compared to surface-based monitoring approaches.
</p>

<p>
    A recent innovative approach to assess site characteristics involves calculating ratios of horizontal to vertical
    components,
    often referred to as H/V ratios. These ratios can be computed using two distinct methods: the horizontal to vertical
    spectral
    ratios of earthquake recordings (eHVSR) and the horizontal to vertical spectral ratio of microtremors (mHVSR). Given
    that the
    primary ground motion impact usually arises from the horizontal component, estimating the horizontal site
    amplification factor
    (HSAF) is crucial for evaluating site effects. However, these methods introduce several noteworthy issues:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>a) Equality of eHVSR and mHVSR</b>: There's a question about whether eHVSR and mHVSR are equivalent.
        Researchers suggests
        that while they share similarities, they are not identical. Researchers have computed a ratio known as EMR
        (Earthquake to Microtremor Ratio) to extract eHVSR information from mHVSR data (<span class="author-ref">Kawase
            et al. 2018</span>).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>b) Relationship between HSAF and eHVSR</b>: It's also important to consider whether HSAF and eHVSR are the
        same. These
        may not be identical, but they can be made equal by adjusting the vertical site amplification factor (VSAF) in
        the
        denominator of the eHVSR calculation (<span class="author-ref">Ito et al. 2020, Maragkakis et al. 2021</span>).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In summary, recent developments in seismic analysis techniques have led to the use of H/V ratios derived from
    earthquake
    recordings and microtremors to estimate site characteristics. However, researchers have found that these methods are
    not
    straightforward and may require adjustments or ratios to accurately capture the specific site amplification effects.
</p>
<h1>H/V ratios from earthquake recordings (eHVSRs)</h5>
    <p>
        While we've previously mentioned Horizontal to Vertical spectral ratios (eHVSRs), their significance
        warrants a dedicated chapter to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this approach. This separate
        chapter will offer
        a more detailed exploration of this critical concept.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2020, Ito and their team introduced an innovative approach, building upon the diffuse field assumption (DFA)
        previously
        developed by <span class="author-ref">Wesley (1982)</span>, as well as the work of <span
            class="author-ref">Sánchez-Sesma et al. 2008, 2011</span>, and <span class="author-ref">Kawase et al.
            2011</span>. This
        approach aimed to calculate the horizontal site amplification factor (HSAF) by utilizing the
        horizontal-to-vertical spectral
        ratios derived from earthquake recordings (eHVSRs) in combination with a correction factor known as the Vertical
        Amplification
        Correction Factor (VACF). The function represented by VACF serves to adjust the eHVSR recordings by eliminating
        the Vertical Site
        Amplification Factor (VSAF) from the denominator of these recordings. This correction process transforms the
        corrected eHVSR into
        an equivalent representation of the horizontal amplification factor, HSAF.
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        <p>HSAF = eHVSR x VACF</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        This method simplifies the calculation of the horizontal site amplification factor (HSAF) by multiplying two key
        components: the
        horizontal to vertical spectra ratio of earthquake recordings (eHVSR) and the vertical amplification correction
        function (VACF).
        <span class="author-ref">Eri Ito (2020) and their colleagues</span> applied this method, in their research paper
        published in the Bulletin of the
        Seismological Society of America. Their study aimed to estimate horizontal site amplification factors based on
        seismic recordings
        in Japan. Similarly, <span class="author-ref">Maragkakis (2021) and their research team </span> employed the
        same methodology to compute horizontal amplification
        factors using recorded data from the Greek region as shown in the ray paths map below.
    </p>

        The final section of this study is focused on validating the outcomes, particularly examining the feasibility of
        simulating horizontal spectral
        amplification in locations where the average spectral ratio eHVSR has been derived solely from earthquake
        records. Subsequently, these calculated values
        are compared with the horizontal spectral amplification factor determined using an independent method, such as
        the classical SSR spectral ratio. This
        comparison serves as a critical assessment to verify the reliability of the study's results. An illustrative
        example of this comparative analysis is conducted
        on the STC and STE stations located in Greece, and the outcomes of this comparison are presented in the figures
        below.

        When we compare the blue and black lines at these stations, it becomes evident that both corrected curves using
        the average and the categorized VACF, can simulate the amplification at an extend. However, it is obvious that
        the application of the categorized correction curve
        leads to a notably improved estimation across the entire frequency spectrum.
