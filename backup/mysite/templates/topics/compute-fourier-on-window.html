<h1>Task Description</h1>
<p>
    In this tutorial, our aim is to compute the Fourier spectra within a specific window on the waveforms.
    This process involves a series of crucial preprocessing steps which enchance the quality of the data and ensure that
    the subsequent Fourier spectra
    analysis is conducted on a refined and targeted portion of the seismic recordings. The preprocessing steps can be
    summarized as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Apply a bandpass filter (1 to 5 Hz)</b>:
        The initial step involves the application of a bandpass filter with a frequency range of 1 to 5 Hz. This
        filtering operation is designed to
        eliminate unwanted noise from the seismic signal, ensuring that only the relevant frequency band is retained for
        further analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Select the P & S wave arrival times</b>:
        Following the bandpass filtering, the identification and selection of arrivals corresponding to the P (primary)
        and S (secondary) waves are
        essential. This step aims to define the edges of the signal and the noise windows at a subsequent step.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Define the signal and the noise window</b>:
        At this point we define the left signal window side to be S wave arrival time and the right side to be 10
        seconds later. Likewise, the
        left side of the noise window is positioned 10 seconds prior to the P wave arrival time, and its right side
        aligns with the P wave arrival.

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Trim recordings inside the 10-second window</b>:
        This step is applied to cut the waveforms into signal and noise windows, created in relation to the P and S wave
        arrivals. Both windows
        will have a consistent duration of 10 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Taper the Waveforms</b>:
        The last step involves the smoothing of the trimmed waveforms in order to ensure zero acceleration values at the
        edges.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>Reading the Input Data</h1>
<p>
    In this article we will make use of the Obspy Python library to apply the seismological computations and the Python
    Matplotlib library to plot the
    waveform time series. For this reason, we will start by initializing the libraries that we will use throughout the
    rest of the article:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/377e201b37db4672889749ced36a8f1f.js"></script>
<p>
    To proceed, read a MiniSEED file containing a record from April 4, 2014, at 20:08:20, recorded by the CH03 station:
</p>

<h1>Application Of the Pre-Processing Steps</h1>
<h2>Apply A Bandpass Filter</h2>
<p>
    Initiate the process by applying a bandpass filter to the records within the frequency range of 1 to 5 Hz. This step
    aims to eliminate surrounding
    noise and facilitate the arrival selection. Utilize the Obspy
    <a href="https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.filter.html" class="link-info"
        target="_blank"><code>filter()</code></a> function
    for this purpose:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/d54cb68d57ebf3759dbc963474a48a6c.js"></script>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="/static/img/obspy-stream-filtered.png" alt="mseed plot">
        <figcaption>Recordings after applying a bandpass filter of 1-5 Hz</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<h2>Select The P And S Wave Arrivals</h2>
<p>
    It's clear from the filtered waveforms, that the P wave arrivals occurs roughly at <code>20:08:36</code> and the S
    wave arrivals at <code>20:08:58</code>.
    Convert these into Obspy <code>UTCDateTime</code> objects and convert the arrival values as total seconds from the
    starting date:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/f5af9772fadcaeedb9dbeafd243f2235.js"></script>
<p>
    To plot the P-wave and S-wave arrivals on the waveforms, we use Matplotlib to mark these time points with vertical
    lines. Here's an example of how you can do it in Python:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/20e1b4548a1b69fe4e5f11c295361c45.js"></script>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="/static/img/arrivals.png" alt="mseed plot">
        <figcaption>Arrivals of the P (red dashed line) and the S (black dashed line) waves</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<h2>Define The Signal And Noise Windows</h2>
<p>
    At this stage we define two windows to calculate the Fourier Spectra, one for the signal part of the waveform and
    one for the noise part.
    Both windows will share the same duration or length of 10 seconds. The first window
    will start from the S wave arrival and the second one will begin 10 seconds before the P wave arrival. Let's
    visualize these windows:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/fb383cf8879d821871f1438d920a0650.js"></script>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="/static/img/windows.png" alt="mseed plot">
        <figcaption>Define the signal and the noise window to calculate the Fourier Spectra. Both will have the same
            duration of 10 seconds. The signal window
            starts at the S wave arrival and ends 10 seconds later. Similarly, the noise window initiates 10 seconds
            prior the P wave arrival and ends at the
            P wave arrival.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<h2>Trim The Waveforms Between The Windows</h2>
<p>
    To continue, trim the waveforms at the two windows using the Obspy
    <a href="https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.trim.html" class="link-info"
        target="_blank"><code>trim()</code></a> function.
    Because the trimming happens inplace, create copies of the orginal <code>Stream</code> object using the
    <code>copy()</code> method:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/8fd9990f4451e595c1a9f5c131dd9110.js"></script>
<p>
    Then plot the trimmed waveforms using the Matplotlib library:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/e250f716129c581c748d408a686d55fc.js"></script>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="/static/img/trimmed.png" alt="mseed plot">
        <figcaption>Trimmed waveforms at the noise and the signal windows for all the components</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<h2>Smooth the waveforms</h2>
<p>
    At the last step, generate another copy of two obects from the previous trimmed recordings and smooth the left and
    the right side of the waveforms, using the obspy
    <a href="https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Trace.taper.html" class="link-info"
        target="_blank"><code>taper()</code></a> function:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/14572aaf70ea874461d23ae6ea0c8f74.js"></script>
<p>
    Lastly, plot the results using Matplotlib:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/dd697ea2048b6f6b930b1f3f2aa5aa4b.js"></script>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
        <img src="/static/img/taper.png" alt="mseed plot">
        <figcaption>Trimmed (blue) and tappered (orange) waveforms at the noise and the signal window for all the
            components</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<h2>Compute The Fourier Spectra</h2>
<p>
    Finally we can calculate the Fourier Spectra at the noise and the signal window on the filtered, trimmed and
    tappered waveforms:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/imarag/e859b97f8e8490d6c9de33aff1e1c73b.js"></script>
<p>
    And we present the results:

<div class="figure-container">

        <figcaption>Fourier Spectra of the signal (bold curve) and the noise (muted curve) window for each component of
            the tappered <code>Stream</code> object</figcaption>
