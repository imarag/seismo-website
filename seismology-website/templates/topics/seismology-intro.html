            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeismic waves are generated at a <b>source</b>, which can be natural, such as an earthquake or artificial, 
                such as an explosion. The generated waves travel through the earth or in other words, through the <b>medium</b> and are recorded at a receiver. The receiver 
                is known as the <b>seismometer</b> and the record of the ground motion at the seismometer is called the <b>seismogram</b>. A seismogram, contains information 
                about both the source and the medium.
            </p>

            <p>
                The generated seismic waves provide information on the location and the nature of the source. If 
                the origin time when the waves left the source is known, their arrival time at the receiver gives the travel time required to pass through the 
                medium. This time gives information about the speed at which they traveled and generally about the physical properties of the medium. In 
                addition because the amplitude of the waves are affected by the medium, the signals observed on seismograms provide additional information 
                about the portion of the earth that the waves traveled through.
            </p>

            <p class="main-block__title main-block__title--medium">Properties of the seismic waves</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeveral properties of the seismic waves are analogous to familiar concepts in the propagation of light and sound. One of 
                these properties is the <b>refraction</b>. Seismic wave velocities generally increase with depth. Because of the different 
                velocities at different depths, wave paths bend away from the vertical as they go deeper into the earth, eventually become 
                horizontal, turn upward, and return to the surface. The wave paths are thus used to infer the variation of seismic velocity,
                and hence the composition and physical properties of material, with depth in the earth. Another property is the <b>reflection</b>
                that occurs when a seismic wave travels to an interface, across which physical properties change, such as the boundary 
                between the earth's mantle and core. In addition to refraction and reflection, waves also undergo <b>diffraction</b> where 
                seismic waves bend around obstacles such as the earth's core.
            </p>

            <p class="main-block__title main-block__title--medium">Earthquakes</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe location of an earthquake is known as the <b>focus</b> or <b>hypocenter</b> and it can be found from the arrival times of seismic 
                waves recorded on seismometers at different sites. This location is often shown by the epicenter, the point on the earth's
                surface above the earthquake. The size of earthquakes is measured from the amplitude of the motion recorded on seismograms
                and given in terms of <b>magnitude</b> or <b>moment</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeismograms are records of the motion of the ground resulting from the arrival of refracted, reflected and diffracted 
                seismic waves. The recorded ground motion is a vector and thus three different components are typically recorded 
                (north-south, east-west, up-down). The generated seismic waves consist of different type of waves. The <b>body waves</b> consist of
                the <b>P</b> or <b>compressional</b> waves that material moves back and forth in the direction in which the wave propagates and the <b>S</b> or 
                <b>shear waves</b> that the material moves at right angles to the propagation direction. P waves are faster that S waves thus the 
                first arriving pulse is a direct P wave. Different other phases of compressional waves can occur after the direct P waves, 
                for example when the wave reflects the surface and then is recorded at the receiver (PP), when then wave reflects the outer core and then end up at the receiver (PcP)
                or when the wave travels through the mantle, the outer and the inner core and then end up at the surface (PKIKP). Among the later arrivals on the seismogram are 
                shear wave phases including the direct arrival S and a shear phase SS that reflected off the surface, analogous to PP.  The large amplitude wave train that arrives 
                later signifies the arrival of different waves called <b>surface</b> waves. <b>Rayleigh</b> wave is an example of this wave. Such waves 
                propagate along paths close to the earth's surface.
