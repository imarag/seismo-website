# Task Description

In this tutorial, our aim is to compute the Fourier spectra within a specific window on the waveforms. This process involves a series of crucial preprocessing steps which enchance the quality of the data and ensure that the subsequent Fourier spectra analysis is conducted on a refined and targeted portion of the seismic recordings. The preprocessing steps can be summarized as follows:

- Apply a bandpass filter (1 to 5 Hz): The initial step involves the application of a bandpass filter with a frequency range of 1 to 5 Hz. This filtering operation is designed to eliminate unwanted noise from the seismic signal, ensuring that only the relevant frequency band is retained for further analysis.
- Select the P & S wave arrival times: Following the bandpass filtering, the identification and selection of arrivals corresponding to the P (primary) and S (secondary) waves are essential. This step aims to define the edges of the signal and the noise windows at a subsequent step.
- Define the signal and the noise window: At this point we define the left signal window side to be S wave arrival time and the right side to be 10 seconds later. Likewise, the left side of the noise window is positioned 10 seconds prior to the P wave arrival time, and its right side aligns with the P wave arrival.
- Trim recordings inside the 10-second window: This step is applied to cut the waveforms into signal and noise windows, created in relation to the P and S wave arrivals. Both windows will have a consistent duration of 10 seconds.
- Taper the Waveforms: The last step involves the smoothing of the trimmed waveforms in order to ensure zero acceleration values at the edges.

# Reading the Input Data

In this article we will make use of the Obspy Python library to apply the seismological computations and the Python Matplotlib library to plot the waveform time series. For this reason, we will start by initializing the libraries that we will use throughout the rest of the article:

```py
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from obspy.core import read
    from obspy.core import UTCDateTime
```

To proceed, read a MiniSEED file containing a record from April 4, 2014, at 20:08:20, recorded by the CH03 station:

```py
    st = read("20140404_200820_CH03.mseed")
    print(st)

    # Output:

    # 3 Trace(s) in Stream:
    # .CH03..E | 2014-04-04T20:08:20.000000Z - 2014-04-04T20:11:10.000000Z | 100.0 Hz, 17001 samples
    # .CH03..N | 2014-04-04T20:08:20.000000Z - 2014-04-04T20:11:10.000000Z | 100.0 Hz, 17001 samples
    # .CH03..Z | 2014-04-04T20:08:20.000000Z - 2014-04-04T20:11:10.000000Z | 100.0 Hz, 17001 samples
```

# Application Of the Pre-Processing Steps

## Apply A Bandpass Filter

Initiate the process by applying a bandpass filter to the records within the frequency range of 1 to 5 Hz. This step aims to eliminate surrounding noise and facilitate the arrival selection. Utilize the Obspy filter() function for this purpose:

```py
    # apply an inplace bandpass filter of 1-5 Hz
    st.filter('bandpass', freqmin=1, freqmax=5)

    # plot the recordings
    st.plot()
```

![Recordings after applying a bandpass filter of 1-5 Hz](/img/obspy-stream-filtered.png)
*Recordings after applying a bandpass filter of 1-5 Hz*

## Select The P And S Wave Arrivals

It's clear from the filtered waveforms, that the P wave arrivals occurs roughly at 20:08:36 and the S wave arrivals at 20:08:58. Convert these into Obspy UTCDateTime objects and convert the arrival values as total seconds from the starting date:

```py
    # Define the P and S wave arrivals as UTCDateTime objects
    Parr = UTCDateTime('2014-04-04 20:08:36')
    Sarr = UTCDateTime('2014-04-04 20:08:58')

    # Get the start date of the records from the first trace of the stream object
    start_date = st[0].stats.starttime

    # Calculate the difference of the P and S wave arrivals from the start date in seconds 
    Parr_sec = Parr - start_date
    Sarr_sec = Sarr - start_date
```

To plot the P-wave and S-wave arrivals on the waveforms, we use Matplotlib to mark these time points with vertical lines. Here's an example of how you can do it in Python:

```py
    # Initialize a matplotlib figure and axes with the total
    # number of plots equal to the number of traces len(st)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(st), 1)

    # Loop through all the traces in the stream object (st)
    for n, tr in enumerate(st):
        # get the time series time information of the current trace
        xdata = tr.times()
        
        # get the data of the current trace
        ydata = tr.data
        
        # plot the graph with legend, the trace component or channel
        ax[n].plot(xdata, ydata, label=tr.stats.channel)
        
        # add two vertical lines that represent the arrivals
        ax[n].axvline(x=Parr_sec, ymin=0, ymax=1, lw=2, ls='--', color='red', label='P arrival')
        ax[n].axvline(x=Sarr_sec, ymin=0, ymax=1, lw=2, ls='--', color='black', label='S arrival')
        
        # add the legend on the plot
        ax[n].legend(loc='upper right')

    # adjust the subplots so they do not overlap
    plt.tight_layout()
```

## Define The Signal And Noise Windows

At this stage we define two windows to calculate the Fourier Spectra, one for the signal part of the waveform and one for the noise part. Both windows will share the same duration or length of 10 seconds. The first window will start from the S wave arrival and the second one will begin 10 seconds before the P wave arrival. Let's visualize these windows:

```py
    # set the window length
    window_length = 10

    # Initialize a matplotlib figure and axes with the total
    # number of plots equal to the number of traces len(st)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(st), 1)

    # Loop through all the traces in the stream object (st)
    for n, tr in enumerate(st):
        # get the time series time information of the current trace
        xdata = tr.times()
        
        # get the data of the current trace
        ydata = tr.data
        
        # plot the graph with legend, the trace component or channel
        ax[n].plot(xdata, ydata, label=tr.stats.channel)

        # add two vertical lines that represent the arrivals
        ax[n].axvline(x=Parr_sec, ymin=0, ymax=1, lw=2, ls='--', color='red', label='P arrival')
        ax[n].axvline(x=Sarr_sec, ymin=0, ymax=1, lw=2, ls='--', color='black', label='S arrival')

        # create the signal and the noise window on the waveforms
        ax[n].fill_betweenx([-1.8,1.8], x1=Sarr_sec, x2=Sarr_sec+window_length, alpha=0.5, facecolor='orange', zorder=2, label='signal window')
        ax[n].fill_betweenx([-1.8,1.8], x1=Parr_sec-window_length, x2=Parr_sec, alpha=0.5, facecolor='red', zorder=2, label='noise window')

        # add the legend on the plot
        ax[n].legend(loc='upper right')

    # adjust the subplots so they do not overlap
    plt.tight_layout()
```

![generation of signal and noise windows to calculate the fourier spectra](/img/windows.png)
*Define the signal and the noise window to calculate the Fourier Spectra. Both will have the same duration of 10 seconds. The signal window starts at the S wave arrival and ends 10 seconds later. Similarly, the noise window initiates 10 seconds prior the P wave arrival and ends at the P wave arrival.*

## Trim The Waveforms Between The Windows

To continue, trim the waveforms at the two windows using the Obspy trim() function. Because the trimming happens inplace, create copies of the orginal Stream object using the copy() method:

```py
    # noise window: from Parr-window_length to Parr
    # signal window: from Sarr to Sarr+window_length
    # Since the trim() function happens inplace, create new stream objects
    # using the copy() function to trim the traces separately
    st_signal = st.copy().trim(starttime=start_date+Sarr_sec, endtime=start_date+Sarr_sec+window_length)
    st_noise = st.copy().trim(starttime=start_date+Parr_sec-window_length, endtime=start_date+Parr_sec)
```

Then plot the trimmed waveforms using the Matplotlib library:

```py
    # Initialize a matplotlib figure and axes with the total  number of rows equal to 
    # the number of traces plus 3 (3 signal traces and 3 noise traces)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(st)+3, 1, figsize=(8,10))

    # Loop through all the traces in the noise Stream
    # and plot them in the first 3 plots of the figure
    for n, tr_noise in enumerate(st_noise):
        # get the time series time information as seconds from the starting date
        xdata = tr_noise.times()
        
        # get the data of the current trace
        ydata = tr_noise.data
        
        # plot the graph
        ax[n].plot(xdata, ydata, label=f'noise window, channel: {tr_noise.stats.channel}')
        
        # add the legend
        ax[n].legend(loc='upper left')

    # Loop through all the traces in the signal Stream
    # and plot them in the next 3 plots of the figure
    for n, tr_signal in enumerate(st_signal, start=3):
        # get the time series time information as seconds from the starting date
        xdata = tr_signal.times()
        
        # get the data of the current trace
        ydata = tr_signal.data
        
        # plot the graph
        ax[n].plot(xdata, ydata, label=f'signal window, channel: {tr_signal.stats.channel}')
        
        # add the legend
        ax[n].legend(loc='upper left')

    # adjust the subplots so they do not overlap
    plt.tight_layout()
```

*Trimmed waveforms at the noise and the signal windows for all the components*

## Smooth the waveforms

At the last step, generate another copy of two obects from the previous trimmed recordings and smooth the left and the right side of the waveforms, using the obspy taper() function:

```py
    # taper the waveforms at the respective windows 30% on the left and 30% on the right side
    # again use the copy() function to apply the taper on new stream object
    st_signal_taper = st_signal.copy().taper(side='both', max_percentage=0.3)
    st_noise_taper = st_noise.copy().taper(side='both', max_percentage=0.3)
```

Lastly, plot the results using Matplotlib:

```py
    # Initialize a matplotlib figure and axes with the total  number of rows equal to 
    # the number of traces plus 3 (3 signal traces and 3 noise traces)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(st)+3, 1, figsize=(8,10))

    # Loop through the number of traces in the noise Stream object
    for i in range(len(st_noise)):
        # plot the trimmed waveforms with blue color
        ax[i].plot(st_noise[i].times(), st_noise[i].data, label=f'trimmed noise window, channel: {st_noise[i].stats.channel}', color="blue")
        
        # plot the tapered waveforms with orange color
        ax[i].plot(st_noise_taper[i].times(), st_noise_taper[i].data, label='tapered', lw=3, color="orange")
        
        # add the legend
        ax[i].legend(loc='upper center')

    # Loop through the number of traces in the signal Stream object
    for i in range(len(st_signal)):
        # plot the trimmed waveforms with blue color
        ax[i+3].plot(st_signal[i].times(), st_signal[i].data, label=f'trimmed signal window, channel: {st_signal[i].stats.channel}', color="blue")
        
        # plot the tapered waveforms with orange color
        ax[i+3].plot(st_signal_taper[i].times(), st_signal_taper[i].data, label='tapered', lw=3, color="orange")
        
        # add the legend
        ax[i+3].legend(loc='upper center')

    # adjust the subplots so they do not overlap
    plt.tight_layout()
```

## Compute The Fourier Spectra

Finally we can calculate the Fourier Spectra at the noise and the signal window on the filtered, trimmed and tappered waveforms:

```py
    # get the first trace of the signal Stream object
    first_trace = st_signal_taper[0]

    # get the starting date of the recordings
    starttime = first_trace.stats.starttime

    # get the sampling frequency and the sample distance
    fs = first_trace.stats["sampling_rate"]
    delta = first_trace.stats["delta"]

    # calculate the nyquist frequency
    fnyq = fs / 2

    # initialize a dictionary to save the outputs
    fourier_data_dict = {}

    # loop through the traces
    for i in range(len(st_signal_taper)):
        # get a copy of the trace for the singal
        df_s = st_signal_taper[i].copy()
        
        # get the current trace channel
        channel = df_s.stats.channel

        # get the number of sample points after the trimming
        npts = df_s.stats["npts"]

        # calculate the number of frequencies on the frequency spectra
        sl = int(npts / 2)

        # calculate the frequnecy array to plot the fourier
        freq_x = np.linspace(0 , fnyq , sl)
        
        # save the frequencies in a variable to use it later at the plotting
        xdata = freq_x

        # compute the fft of the signal
        yf_s = np.fft.fft(df_s.data[:npts]) 
        y_write_s = delta * np.abs(yf_s)[0:sl]

        # do the same also for the noise part
        # get a copy of the trace for the noise
        df_p = st_noise_taper[i].copy()

        # calculate the fft
        yf_p = np.fft.fft(df_p.data[:npts]) 
        y_write_p = delta * np.abs(yf_p)[0:sl]
        
        # add the fft of the signal and noise part to the dictionary for the current trace
        fourier_data_dict[channel] = {"signal": y_write_s, "noise": y_write_p}
```

And we present the results:

```py
    # initialize a Matplotlib figure to plot the Fourier data
    figfourier, axfourier = plt.subplots(1, len(fourier_data_dict),  figsize=(19,6))

    # create a hex colors list to style the curves
    colors = ['#5E62FF', '#B9BBFF', '#0a0a0a', '#969595', '#b50421', '#fc8b9e']

    color_i = 0
    # loop through each component at the dictionary
    for n, compo in enumerate(fourier_data_dict):
        # loop through the 'noise' and the 'signal' part
        for s_n in fourier_data_dict[compo]:
            # define the ydata with data located in the dictionary created earlier
            ydata = fourier_data_dict[compo][s_n]
            
            # create a variable to save the legend name of the curves
            label_name = f"{compo}-{s_n}"
            
            # plot the frequencies and the data
            axfourier[n].plot(xdata, ydata, color=colors[color_i], lw=1, label=label_name)
            color_i += 1
        
        # style the graphs 
        axfourier[n].legend(loc='upper left', fontsize=11, facecolor='w')
        axfourier[n].set_xscale('log')
        axfourier[n].set_yscale('log')
        axfourier[n].set_xlabel("frequency [Hz]", fontsize=14)
        axfourier[n].grid(color='grey', ls='-', which='both', alpha=0.1)
        axfourier[n].tick_params(axis='both', which='both', labelsize=14)

    plt.tight_layout()
```
